Figure~\ref{TAblindpointing} shows the observed blind-pointing results for the three COS TA modes: NUV imaging, NUV spectroscopic, and FUV spectroscopic.Overall, we observe an initial pointing bias of [AD,XD] = [\blindad,\blindxd]\arcsec.In general, the $1\sigma$ accuracy of guide stars in the GSC2 is $\sim$0.4\arcsec\,so the standard deviation of our blind pointing is slighter higher than the guide star accuracy due to target coordinate uncertainties.The initial pointing bias of [-0.23,-0.18]\arcsec\ was, however, not expected and was the result of a minor FGS-to-COS misalignment (see \tamonISR).%or a spacecraft or COS mechanism drift problem (the target is always drifting in the same direction during TA).\clearpage\section{COS Target Acquisition Modes}In the next four sections, we will examine each of these modes in detail,particularly when the TA centering accuracy depends upon the proper choiceof TA mode option. A summary of the recommended values of all TA mode options is given in \S~\ref{sec:Summary} (Table~\ref{table:TAoptions}). Each TA modes uses TA flight software (FSW) parameters which are not specifiable by the user. A description of each of these parameters is given in Appendix~\ref{sec:FSWdescription},and the current and past values of the important TA FSW parameters are given in Appendix~\ref{sec:FSWparameters}.\subsection{Using \tacq{SEARCH}}\label{sec:SEARCH}An \tacq{SEARCH} is fully defined by specifying the three TA parameters\texttt{SCAN-SIZE}, \texttt{STEP-SIZE}, and the \texttt{CENTER} method andcan be performed in imaging or spectroscopic made.\texttt{SCAN-SIZE} can be 2, 3, 4, or 5 (the upper limit is set by theTA parameter \textsc{pcta\_MaxScanSize}). \texttt{STEP-SIZE} can range from 0.001\arcsec\ to 2.0\arcsec\(the FSW parameters \textsc{pcta\_MinStepSize} and \textsc{pcta\_MaxStepSize}).The recommended value of \texttt{STEP-SIZE} is the default (1.767\arcsec).This is the largest \texttt{STEP-SIZE} that covers the sky without internal gaps or holes in on-sky coverage,and should be used in almost all cases. The \texttt{CENTER} method can be \texttt{FWF} (Flux-Weighted-Floor),\texttt{FW} (Flux-Weighted), or \texttt{RTB} (Return to Brightest). \texttt{CENTER=FWF} is recommended for\texttt{SCAN-SIZE}=3 or larger, while \texttt{CENTER=FW} is recommended for \texttt{SCAN-SIZE}=2.Use of \texttt{CENTER=FWF} with \texttt{SCAN-SIZE}=2 produces an asymmetric pattern that pulls thetarget away from proper centering.\texttt{CENTER=FWF} centers better than \texttt{CENTER=FW} because it subtracts the lowest counts in anydwell point from all counts, which acts as a crude background removal. A simple schematic of \texttt{STEP-SIZE}=2--5,\texttt{SCAN-SIZE}=1.767\arcsec\ \tacq{SEARCH}s are given in Figure~\ref{Patterns}. The {\color{red}red} circle here has aradius of 3\arcsec, and is useful in comparing the area on the sky covered by the available patterns.{\color{blue}Blue} numbers show the order of the dwells in the pattern, and the pre-launch PSF is shown in the center for comparison.Ray-tracing and computer simulations for the NUV (COS-11-0024A) andFUV (COS-11-0016A) predict that properly designed \tacq{SEARCH}s shouldcenter the target to within 0.1--0.2\arcsec\ in all modes in both AD and XD,if the target was within the box on the sky contained by the outer dwell points.These simulations were based upon the predicted, not the observed PSF, (see Figure~\ref{PSF} and COS ISR 2010-01).The observed PSF is noticeably asymmetric and contains a much larger percentageof the light in the extended wings. The PSF asymmetriesand extended wings, along with the extended transmission function of the aperture(Figure~\ref{Transmission}), tend to feed incorrect information into the \tacq{SEARCH} centeringalgorithm.For these reasons, a single \tacq{SEARCH} should be not expected to center the targetto better than 0.3\arcsec\ in either AD and XD. Depending on where the targetfalls in the \tacq{SEARCH} pattern, it could be as much as 0.5\arcsec\ off-center. This is why we recommend thatall TAs follow up their initial \tacq{SEARCH} with either an \tacq{IMAGE}, \tacq{PEAKXD}+\texttt{PEAKD}, or a second 2x2 \tacq{SEARCH}.The NUV detector background has risen from about 60 counts/s to 400 counts/s since May 2009, with an annual rate of increase of $\sim$226 counts/year (see \S~\ref{sec:TAback}).The original NUV imaging and spectroscopic TA subarrays comprised $\sim$13\% of the NUV detector and are were counting 31--46 counts/s of detector backgroundas of mid-2010.Under the simplifying assumption that during an \tacq{SEARCH} the weakest background counts will be 1$\sigma$ low and the brightest will be 1$\sigma$ high, when using \texttt{CENTER=FWF} the target should be brighter than $2 \times \sqrt(\textrm{maximum background rate})$ toavoid significant pointing error due to background contamination. For normally distributed background events and observations away from the SAA, this is $\sim$14 counts/s, or \tacq{SEARCH} dwells times of greater than $\sim$120s for target equal to S/N=40 TAs.For cases using \texttt{CENTER=FW}, the target should be brighter than or equal to the maximum expected background rate to provide adequate centering (count rates greater than 50 counts/s and dwell times less than 35s).In cases where the target does not meet these criteria, other COS TA strategies should be employed.\\As discussed in \S~\ref{sec:TAback}, NUV imaging \tacq{SEARCH} TA subarrays were optimized (reduced) during mid-2010, and theabove warning about NUV \tacq{SEARCH}s now only apply to spectroscopic TAs.\clearpage\vspace{-0.3cm}\subsection{\tacq{IMAGE}}\label{sec:acqimage}\vspace{-0.3cm}When mirrors are selected on both Optics Select Mechanisms (OSMs), COS can be used in NUV imaging mode. \tacq{IMAGE}uses this mode to center a point-source, or the brightest point in an extended object, in the aperture.All COS apertures are on a common aperture plate, and therefore have a fixed physical offset.Flashing the on-board Pt-Ne wavelength calibration lamp allows the determination of the positionof the wavelength calibration aperture (WCA) on the NUV detector.COS has two Pt-Ne lamps; \plamp{2} is used exclusively for TA and \plamp{1} is used for wavelength calibration. Once the positionof the WCA is known, the center of the other apertures can be precisely calculated.NUV \tacq{IMAGE} observations can use either the PSA or BOA aperture and either MIRRORA or MIRRORB modes.MIRRORA mode is simply using a flat mirror on OSM2.This mirror has 2mm thick UV grade fused silica `order sorter' on the front which suppresses light at $\lambda < 1600 \AA$.The order-sorter was placed in front of the gratings, so that the light makes two passes through the filter before reaching the detector.UV grade fused silica transmits well for $\lambda > 1700\AA$, but is almost totally opaque for $\lambda$ < 1600$\AA$.while MIRRORB is a slight rotation of OSM2 so that light reflects off the order-sorting filter in front of the mirror.The TA order sorter has a slight wedge of $\sim$ 30\arcsec in the AD.This produces two images, one from the front surface reflection off of the order sorter,and a second reflecting off of the back surface of the order sorter.The second reflection is dimmer by a factor of $\sim$ 0.48\footnote{Since the primary reflection does not pass through the order sorter, but the secondary image dose, this ratio is target SED dependent.}, therefore MIRRORB produces two target images in a $\sim$ 2:1 intensity ratio.Each of these modes has different WCA-to-aperture offsets that are stored in the COS FSWas the parameter \textsc{pcta\_CalTargetOffset} (Table~\ref{table:TAcaltargetoffset}).Details of this TA step, known as \fsw{IMCAL}, are given in \S~\ref{sec:LTAIMCAL}.\begin{figure}[htb]\includegraphics[angle=90,scale=0.9,width=0.99\textwidth]{png/ordersorter.png}\caption{Overview of the COS TA MIRROR hardware optics.\label{fig:ordersorter}}\end{figure}Once the desired position of the aperture+MIRROR center has been determined, an image of the sky istaken to determine the initial target position. Using the plate scale parameters stored in the FSWconstants \textsc{pcta\_NUVMilliArcsecsPerPixelX} and \textsc{pcta\_NUVMilliArcsecsPerPixelY} (Table~\ref{table:TAscalar}),the calculated target motion required tocenter the target in pixels is converted to arc-seconds (\arcsec) and HST is commanded to slew therequired amount to center the target in the aperture. Details of this TA step, knownas \texttt{LTAIMAGE} are given in \S~\ref{sec:LTAIMAGE}.After slewing to the desired location, \tacq{IMAGE} takes a second image of the skyto verify that the target was centered as desired. The two images, and the results of theWCA target location, are returned in the \texttt{IPPPSSOOT\_rawacq.fits} file. In \S~\ref{sec:IMAGEcentering},we evaluate the performance of the four \texttt{APERTURE+MIRROR} \tacq{IMAGE}modes and compare them to our centering requirements.\vspace{-0.3cm}\begin{deluxetable}{|r|r|r|r|r|}\tablewidth{0pt}\tabcolsep 6pt\tablecolumns{5}\tabletypesize{\footnotesize}\tablecaption{On-Orbit \texttt{LTIMCAL} Measurements\label{table:tableWCA}.}\tablehead{ \colhead{Aperture} & \colhead{MIRROR} & \colhead{AD Position}& \colhead{XD Position} & \colhead{\# of \texttt{LTAIMCALs}}}\startdataPSA & MIRRORA & 474.0 $\pm$ 15.5 &370.0 $\pm$ 0.6 &80 \\PSA & MIRRORB & 689.0 $\pm$ 11.9 &209.0 $\pm$ 0.8 & 116 \\\hlineBOA & MIRRORA & 474.0 $\pm$ 15.0 &370.0 $\pm$ 0.8 & 46 \\BOA & MIRRORB & 684.0 $\pm$ 8.8 &208.0 $\pm$ 0.8 & 6 \\\hlineALL & MIRRORA & 474.0 $\pm$ 15.3 &370.0 $\pm$ 0.6 & 126 \\ALL & MIRRORB & 689.0 $\pm$ 11.8 &209.0 $\pm$ 0.8 & 122 \\\hline\enddata%Updated May 25, 2018\tablecomments{The reported positions are the median detector coordinates.The proposed subarrays shown in Figure~\ref{LTAIMCALpos} are derived from these measurements.}\end{deluxetable}The average number of counts in the WCA \texttt{LTAIMCAL} MIRRORA images was 3233$\pm$68(a 7-second exposure with \plamp{2} at low current).The average number of counts in the WCA \texttt{LTAIMCAL} MIRRORB images was 798$\pm$153(a 30-second exposure with \plamp{2} at low current).The average number of counts in the primary MIRRORB image was 2/3 of this value ($\sim535$).As discussed in \S~\ref{sec:TAback}, the COS dark rate is currently $\sim$220--330 counts/s over the entire detector, or $\sim$31--46 counts/s in the WCA subarray.The WCA MIRRORB exposures are currently 30 seconds in duration, so the total background in the subarray is $\sim930$ counts, comparable to the counts in the lamp images.Figure~\ref{LTAIMCALrates} shows the \texttt{LTAIMCAL} counts as a function of time.The solid crosses indicate the total number of accumulated counts during the {\color{green}MIRRORA}and {\color{blue}MIRRORB} \texttt{LTAIMCAL}. The solid lines give the moving average of the measured counts.There is significant scatter in the total \texttt{LTAIMCAL} counts due to detector background whichis related to the temperature of the NUV MAMA tube (\texttt{LNTUBET}). As discussed inPascucci et al. 2010, this relationship has been estimated as : \begin{equation}\label{eq:NUVcps} 	{\rm NUV~Dark~Rate =}~ 1.1\times~10^9~~exp({{-8791}\over{T_c + 273.16}})~({{(t-t_0)}\over{163}} + 1.5) \end{equation}where t$_0$ is the modified Julian date of 55100.0 (2009.269) and T$_c$ is the MAMA tube temperature tracked by theCOS keyword \texttt{LNTUBET}.\begin{figure}[b]\center\includegraphics[angle=90,scale=1.0,width=0.99\textwidth]{eps/wca_positions_nota_ALL.eps}\caption[WCA \texttt{LTAIMCAL} Positions]{\small Representation of the NUV detector showing the locations of the wavelengthcalibration lamp images (WCA, \texttt{LTAIMCAL}) and the initial positions of the target images (PSA/BOA, \texttt{LTAIMAGE}).The two solid boxes on the left show the current MIRRORA and MIRRORB WCA TA subarrays capturing the WCA lamp locations for both {\color{magenta}PSA} and {\color{blue}BOA} \tacq{IMAGE}S.

The solid lines are a moving average of the calibration lamp plus the detector background counts.As explained in the text, from the date and the temperature of the NUV MAMA we can estimate the detector background presentin the \texttt{LTAIMCAL} subarrays. After subtracting this estimate of the detector background,we determine the number of \texttt{LTAIMCAL} calibration lamp events as a function of date.The wavelength calibration lamp used during LTIMCAL appears to be stable over the sampled interval.The {\color{green}MIRRORA} count rates are clearly adequate, but the {\color{blue}MIRRORB} count ratesin the two {\color{blue}MIRRORB} images appear to be dropping and this exposure time should be monitored and adjusted for Cycle~19.\label{LTAIMCALrates}}\end{figure}\vspace{-0.3cm}\subsection{\tacq{PEAKXD}}\tacq{PEAKXD} sequences start with a 17-second flash of \plamp{2} at medium current to locate the wavelength calibration spectrum (WCS, or WCA spectrum) in dispersed light on the detector.For NUV TAs, one must specify the stripe to be used in centering.The optional parameter is {\it STRIPE=A, B} (DEFAULT), or {\it C}, or in APT, {\it STRIPE=SHORT, MEDIUM, LONG}.For FUV TAs, one must specify which segment(s) to use ({\it SEGMENT=A} (DEFAULT for G140L){\it, B} or {\it BOTH} (DEFAULT for G130M, G160M).To limit the amount of detector background contributing to the WCS location, a single subarray is used for the NUV detector and one for each of the FUV segments (if applicable).The values of these WCS \tacq{PEAKXD} TA subarrays are given for the NUV and FUV in Tables~\ref{table:TAnuvPEAKXDxc} and \ref{table:TAsubWCAfuv} for the FUV channel.Once the XD location of the NUV WCS for the {\it STRIPE} selected is determined (using amedian, \textsc{pcta\_UseMedian4CAL4NUV=TRUE}), the expected location of the median (\textsc{pcta\_UseMedian4PKXD4NUV=TRUE})of the spectral stripe (BOA or PSA) is calculated using the grating and aperture specific parameter \textsc{CalTargetOffset} given inTable~\ref{table:TAcaltargetoffset}.The \tacq{PEAKXD} target exposure is then taken and the slew required to center the target is calculated and performed.For NUV TAs, the FSW always uses the XD separation between the WCA and the target aperture for \texttt{STRIPE=B}. As a result,NUV \tacq{PEAKXD} exposures taken with stripes other than \texttt{STRIPE=B} will be mis-centered in the XD directionby as much as 2.5p (0.06\arcsec).In addition, due to the slope of NUV spectra on the detector, targets with different spectral energy distributions willcenter slightly differently ($\leq 2p = 0.05$\arcsec).In the COS FSW, a single NUV parameter is used for the XD plate scalefor all gratings (\textsc{pcta\_NUVMilliArcsecsPerPixelXDisp}).This value of this parameter was set in SMOV to 0.02384 mas/p.The actual NUV plate scale is, however, grating dependent.The estimates in Table~\ref{table:TAnuvPS} were derived in COS 2010-08 (Ghavamian, 2010).The maximum difference from the FSW value is the G285M value, with a difference of $24.4-23.84 = 0.56$ mas/p.This is a XD displacement of 2p (0.05\arcsec) in XD for a 1.1\arcsec\ G285M/\tacq{PEAKXD} adjustment.For the FUV channel, the differences in XD plate scale are much larger and each gratinguses its own grating specific value of (\textsc{pcta\_FUVMilliArcsecsPerPixelXDisp}) as given in Table~\ref{table:TAscalar}.There is one additional complication due to the off-axis alignment of the COS NUV channel.The act of centering an NUV target in the XD direction moves the target in the AD directionas given by the $\alpha_{yx}$ column in Table~\ref{table:TAnuvPS}. This parameter has unitsof p/\arcsec\ of motion. In the worst case (G225M), a 1.25\arcsec\ PEAKXD centering will move the target 8.4p (0.20\arcsec)in the AD. For this reason, NUV \tacq{PEAKXD}s should always precede \tacq{PEAKD}s. Also given inTable~\ref{table:TAnuvPS} is the amount of motion in the XD direction for NUV AD motion($\alpha_{xy}$). A 1.25\arcsec\ NUV \tacq{PEAKD} TA will move the target in the XD by a much smaller amount,at most 0.4p (0.01\arcsec) for G185M.Because of cross-contamination between the spectral stripes,NUV \tacq{PEAKXD}s will not work properly for extended sources, and should be avoided.\clearpageFUV \tacq{PEAKXD}s are performed in ``raw'' coordinates and do not receive the thermal and geometric corrections ofscience data. The raw coordinate systems of each FUV segment are different.\tacq{PEAKXD}s that use both segments must map the Segment-B detector ``Y'' (XD)positions to Segment-A coordinates before determining thecombined Segment-A plus Segment-B WCS and PSA/BOA XD locations.The FUV mapping is determined by the grating specific parameters \textsc{pcta\_XDispInterceptCoeff}and \textsc{pcta\_XDispSlopeCoeff} (Table~\ref{table:TAscalar}).Unlike the NUV, the FUV XD location determinationsgive better results when using a mean to determine the XD locations (\textsc{pcta\_UseMedian4CAL4FUV=FALSE},and \textsc{pcta\_UseMedian4PKXD4FUV=FALSE}). Because of the thermal and geometric distortions presentin raw FUV data, and the slight slope of FUV spectra on the detector, targets with different spectralenergy distributions will center slightly differently during FUV \tacq{PEAKXD}s. This effect has beenmeasured as {$\leq2~DE = 0.2$\arcsec}, less than our centering goal of $\pm0.3$\arcsec.For the NUV, TA extraction subarrays isolate the \texttt{STRIPE} in use.Table~\ref{table:TAnuvPEAKXDxc} gives the lower-left corner in $X_{detector}$ (XC) for all three stripesfor each grating and the WCA and PSA/BOA. All NUV PEAKXD subarrays have YC=0, YS=1024, and XS=81.FUV TA subarrays must also exclude the geocoronal emission lines for each \texttt{SEGMENT}.The subarrays described in the \tacq{SEARCH} section (\S~\ref{sec:SEARCH}) and Appendix~\ref{sec:TAsubs} are also used for \tacq{PEAKXD}.The geocoronal lines excluded by the FUV TA subarrays are given in Table~\ref{table:GEO}.FUV TA subarrays exclude only those lines above the double line in Table~\ref{table:GEO} (Daytime $> 0.2$~kR).The observer should be aware of possible spectral contamination from the other lines, but these lines should not affect TA.Since COS FUV TAs are done in raw coordinates (no thermal or geometric corrections), thetemperature at the time of the TA affects the XD location of the WCA and PSA/BOA spectra onthe detector. As outlined in COS-2010-13 (COS FUV and NUV On-Orbit Structural and Thermal Stability),these digital locations will experience virtual oscillations of up to $\pm$ 0.05\arcsec\ in one orbit due to internal COS thermal instability.The XD components of the four FUV stim locations move approximately in step with orbital phase, but with varyingmagnitude As a result, the relative offset between the WCA and science aperture does not change as much as the absolute positions.The overall XD centering error in \tacq{PEAKXD} due to thermal effects should be $\le 0.25$~DE (digital element), or $\le 0.025$\arcsec.On the other hand, geometric distortions can affect overall XD centering by as much as 2~DE, or $0.2$\arcsec. Statistics on theeffects of geometric distortion on FUV XD \tacq{PEAKXD} centering are difficult to determine since the XD profiles are returned as a TA data product.COS FUV on-orbit spectra are not perfectly aligned with the detector; there is a slight slope to both the WCA and PSA/BOA spectra ($\approx -0.27$ XD(DE) per 1000 AD(DE)).This slope equates to an $\approx 3.5$ DE XD offset from the beginning to end of each segment.This obviously broadens the XD profiles of both the WCA and PSA/BOA spectra, making centroidingless precise and a function of the target spectral energy distribution (SED).Since COS TA spectra are not geometrically corrected either, the XD profiles are further broadenedin non-linear fashion. FUV \tacq{PEAKXD} centering accuracy is therefore mildly \texttt{CENWAVE} dependent, even for the same target.On-orbit, we have observed the centerings listed in Table~\ref{table:XDonorbit} with \tacq{PEAKXD} between days 2009.215--\reallastdate.In all cases, the \tacq{PEAKXD} is following a spectroscopic \tacq{SEARCH}.Overall, \tacq{PEAKXD} is correcting for \tacq{SEARCH} errors by XX$\pm$YY\arcsec,clearly indicating its importance in properly centering targets in the XD.The $1\sigma$ standard deviation indicates that \tacq{SEARCH} is centering thetarget in the XD direction to within $\pm$0.3\arcsec\ about $90$\% of the time, but to within our desiredaccuracy of $\pm$0.1\arcsec only $50$\% of the time.By examining COS spectra, we can directly measure the final XD accuracies achieved by \tacq{PEAKXD} compared to the commanded XD positions.The results for the NUV observations are given in Table~\ref{table:XDonorbitACCNUV} and the FUV results are given in Table~\ref{table:XDonorbitACCFUV}.These results include all observations taken between 2009.215 and \reallastdate.Due to incorrect WCA-to-PSA parameters, NUV BOA spectroscopic TAs will not correctly center the target in the aperture.No BOA spectroscopic TAs are scheduled for Cycle~17. A PR will be filed to correct this before Cycle~18.\begin{deluxetable}{|r|r|r|r|r|}\tabcolsep 8pt\tablecolumns{5}\tablewidth{0pt}\tablecaption{Average On-Orbit \tacq{PEAKXD} Centering Moves.\label{table:XDonorbit}}\tabletypesize{\footnotesize}\tablehead{\colhead{Grating/Channel} & \colhead{Aperture} & \colhead{$|$XD Offset$|$} & \colhead{$\sigma_{|XD\ Offset|}$} & \colhead{\# of Centerings}}\startdata\hline\hlineG130M & PSA & -0.119\arcsec\ & 0.168\arcsec\ & 98 \\G160M & PSA & -0.224\arcsec\ & 0.091\arcsec\ & 30 \\G140L & PSA & -0.188\arcsec\ & 0.094\arcsec\ & 18 \\\hlineG130M & BOA & -0.208\arcsec\ & 0.177\arcsec\ & 4 \\G160M & BOA & \nodata\ & \nodata\ & 0 \\G140L & BOA & \nodata\ & \nodata\ & 0 \\\hlineFUV & PSA & -0.149" & 0.153" & 146 \\FUV & BOA & -0.208" & 0.177" & 4 \\\hline\hlinePSA & ALL & -0.085\arcsec\ & 0.157\arcsec\ & 223\\BOA & ALL & -0.179\arcsec\ & 0.166\arcsec\ & 5\\\hline\hline%\hline%G130M & PSA & -0.111\arcsec\ & 0.170\arcsec\ & 65 \\%G160M & PSA & -0.207\arcsec\ & 0.072\arcsec\ & 22 \\%G140L & PSA & -0.156\arcsec\ & 0.054\arcsec\ & 11 \\%\hline%G130M & BOA & -0.208\arcsec\ & 0.177\arcsec\ & 4 \\%G160M & BOA &\nodata\ & \nodata\ & 0 \\%G140L & BOA & \nodata\ & \nodata\ & 0 \\%\hline%FUV & PSA & -0.137\arcsec\ & 0.149\arcsec\ & 98 \\%FUV & BOA & -0.208\arcsec\ & 0.177\arcsec\ & 4 \\%\hline%\hline%PSA & ALL & -0.075\arcsec\ & 0.153\arcsec\ & 150\\%BOA & ALL & -0.179\arcsec\ & 0.166\arcsec\ & 5\\%\hline%\hline% Updated May 5, 2010\enddata\tablecomments{Previous NUV+FUV PSA+BOA TA stages centered the target to within $\pm$0.3\arcsec\prior to \tacq{PEAKXD} 90\% of the time, and within $\pm$0.1\arcsec\ only 50\% of the time.}\end{deluxetable}\begin{deluxetable}{|r|r|r|r|r|r|r|r|}\tabcolsep 4pt\tablecolumns{8}\tablewidth{0pt}\tablecaption{FUV/PSA On-Orbit \tacq{PEAKXD} Accuracies.\label{table:XDonorbitACCFUV}}\tabletypesize{\scriptsize}\tablehead{\colhead{FUV} & \colhead{Cenwave} & \colhead{$\Delta$XD$_{measured}$} & \colhead{$\sigma_{measured}$} &\colhead{\# of ACQ/} & \colhead{$\Delta$XD$_{commanded}$} & \colhead{$\delta\Delta$XD} &\colhead{FUV}\\\colhead{Grating} & \colhead{(\AA)} & \colhead{(PSA-WCA)} & \colhead{(PSA-WCA)} &\colhead{PEAKXDs\tablenotemark{b}} & \colhead{(PSA-WCA)} & \colhead{(measured-commanded)} &\colhead{Segment}}\startdataG130M &	1291 & -88.13 & 1.05 & 47 & -87.80 & 0.33 &FUVA \\G130M &	1291 & -88.29 & 1.08 & 40 & -87.80 & 0.49 &FUVB \\G130M &	1291 & -86.28 & 4.72 & 46 & -87.80 & -1.52 &FUVAB \\\hlineG130M &	1300 & -88.29 & 1.07 & 23 & -87.80 & 0.49 &FUVA \\G130M &	1300 & -88.55 & 1.38 & 23 & -87.80 & 0.75 &FUVB \\G130M &	1300 & -88.08 & 1.25 & 23 & -87.80 & 0.28 &FUVAB \\\hlineG130M &	1309 & -88.29 & 2.85 & 45 & -87.80 & 0.49 &FUVA \\G130M &	1309 & -88.67 & 3.88 & 41 & -87.80 & 0.87 &FUVB \\G130M &	1309 & -87.93 & 3.58 & 41 & -87.80 & 0.13 &FUVAB \\\hlineG130M &	1318 & -87.31 & 1.14 & 15 & -87.80 & -0.49 &FUVA \\G130M &	1318 & -88.45 & 1.32 & 15 & -87.80 & 0.65 &FUVB \\G130M &	1318 & -87.60 & 1.18 & 15 & -87.80 & -0.20 &FUVAB \\\hlineG130M &	1327 & -88.43 & 1.01 & 9 & -87.80 & 0.63 &FUVA \\G130M &	1327 & -89.10 & 1.13 & 7 & -87.80 & 1.30 &FUVB \\G130M &	1327 & -88.70 & 1.00 & 8 & -87.80 & 0.90 &FUVAB \\\hlineG130M &	ALL & -88.01 & 1.28 & 135 & -87.80 & 0.21 &FUVA \\G130M &	ALL & -88.43 & 1.57 & 124 & -87.80 & 0.63 &FUVB \\G130M &	ALL & -87.79 & 1.44 & 124 & -87.80 & -0.01 &FUVAB \\\hline\hlineG160M &	1577 & -88.28 & 1.07 & 5 & -87.80 & 0.48 &FUVA \\G160M &	1577 & -89.28 & 1.54 & 6 & -87.80 & 1.48 &FUVB \\G160M &	1577 & -89.06 & 1.43 & 6 & -87.80 & 1.26 &FUVAB \\\hlineG160M &	1589 & -88.21 & 2.38 & 41 & -87.80 & 0.41 &FUVA \\G160M &	1589 & -89.29 & 2.71 & 45 & -87.80 & 1.49 &FUVB \\G160M &	1589 & -89.77 & 3.02 & 49 & -87.80 & 1.97 &FUVAB \\\hlineG160M &	1600 & -87.66 & 1.16 & 48 & -87.80 & -0.14 &FUVA \\G160M &	1600 & -89.09 & 1.28 & 52 & -87.80 & 1.29 &FUVB \\G160M &	1600 & -88.97 & 1.39 & 52 & -87.80 & 1.17 &FUVAB \\\hlineG160M &	1611 & -88.99 & 1.07 & 26 & -87.80 & 1.19 &FUVA \\G160M &	1611 & -89.35 & 1.20 & 24 & -87.80 & 1.55 &FUVB \\G160M &	1611 & -89.42 & 1.31 & 24 & -87.80 & 1.62 &FUVAB \\\hlineG160M &	1623 & -88.86 & 1.14 & 45 & -87.80 & 1.06 &FUVA \\G160M &	1623 & -90.00 & 1.29 & 43 & -87.80 & 2.20 &FUVB \\G160M &	1623 & -89.84 & 1.31 & 45 & -87.80 & 2.04 &FUVAB \\\hlineG160M &	ALL & -88.34 & 1.33 & 163 & -87.80 & 0.54 &FUVA \\G160M &	ALL & -89.37 & 1.41 & 167 & -87.80 & 1.57 &FUVB \\G160M &	ALL & -89.42 & 1.46 & 171 & -87.80 & 1.62 &FUVAB \\\hline\hlineG140L &	1105 & -86.61 & 1.41 & 8 & -86.40 & 0.21 &FUVA \\G140L &	1230 & -86.89 & 3.11 & 46 & -86.40 & 0.49 &FUVA \\\hlineG140L &	ALL & -86.85 & 2.92 & 54 & -86.40 & 0.45 &FUVA \\\hline\hline\enddata\vspace{-0.5cm}\tablecomments{Offsets are broken down by segment;

Excepting the FUV dark count measurements taken between 2009.5--2009.7(which included intentional excursions near the SAA during SMOV), the FUV dark count rate is constant for bothsegments at around 3 counts/second over the TA subarrays.Gaussian error bars ($\sqrt{counts}$) are included in the figure, but are smaller than the plotting symbols.\\\clearpageDiscuss updated parameter table.\clearpage\section{Summary}\label{sec:Summary}\vspace{-0.3cm}In 2010, a series of minor adjustments are planned to further enhance the performance of COS TA based upon the performance ofGTO and GO TAs under on-orbit usage.\begin{deluxetable}{|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|}%\rotate\tabcolsep 3pt\tablecolumns{7}\tablewidth{0pt}\tablecaption{Recommended TA Options\label{table:TAoptions}}\tabletypesize{\scriptsize}\tablehead{\colhead{Acquisition Type} &\colhead{Description} & \colhead{SCAN-SIZE} & \colhead{STEP-SIZE (\arcsec)}&\colhead{Parameters} &\colhead{Recommendation} &\colhead{Required S/N}}\startdataACQ/SEARCH & Spiral pattern; & 2 & 1.767 & \texttt{CENTER=FW,FWF,RTB} & FW & 40\\&Multiple&3&1.767&&FWF& 40\\&exposures&4&1.767&&FWF & 40\\&&5&1.767&&FWF & 40\\ACQ/PEAKXD & One exposure &N/A&N/A&FUV: \texttt{SEGMENT=A,B,BOTH} &BOTH& 40\\&&N/A&N/A&NUV: \texttt{STRIPE=A,B,C} & B (MED)&40 to 100\\ACQ/PEAKD & Linear pattern; & 3 & 1.5\tablenotemark{a} & \texttt{CENTER=FW,FWF,RTB} & FW & 40 to 100\\&Multiple&5 & 1.1\tablenotemark{a} && FWF & \\&exposures&7 & 1.0 && FWF&\\&&9 & 0.7\tablenotemark{b} && FWF&\\ACQ/IMAGE & Initial and &1&N/A&Aperture=PSA,BOA&& 40 (PSA)\\   & confirm images &1&N/A&Mirror=A,B&& 40 60 (BOA)\enddata\tablenotetext{a}{The previously recommended value was 1.2\arcsec.}\tablenotetext{b}{The previously recommended value was 1.0\arcsec.}\end{deluxetable} Our updated recommendations are:\begin{enumerate}\item{All TA modes are providing good centering, although there is some room for improvement in certain modes.\footnote{See \#8 and 10, which discuss known problems with FUV/G160M and NUV/BOA spectroscopic TAs.}If you need maximum wavelength accuracy, use NUV imaging mode,otherwise use the mode that is fastest based upon STScI ETC simulation.}\item{A single \tacq{SEARCH} is not sufficient to center a COS point-source target in the aperture; always follow up the first \tacq{SEARCH} with an \tacq{IMAGE}, \tacq{PEAKXD}+\tacq{PEAKD}, or a second 2x2 \tacq{SEARCH}.}\item{With the correction to the FGS-to-COS offset (the SIAF update), COS \tacq{SEARCH} requirements can be relaxed to allow faster target centering. The recommended \tacq{SEARCH} \texttt{SCAN-SIZE} parameters listed in Table~\ref{table:ssgoal}, are based primarily upon the confidence observers have in their target coordinates.Spending extra time to validate target coordinates is the best way save TA time.}\item{Use \texttt{STRIPE}=B if at all possible for NUV spectroscopic \tacq{PEAKXD}s.}\item{Because of potential cross-contamination between stripes, NUV spectroscopic TAs should not be used with extended sources.}\item{Use \texttt{SCAN-SIZE}=5, \texttt{STEP-SIZE}=0.9, and \texttt{CENTER}=FWF for most \tacq{PEAKD} centerings.For the most accurate AD centering possible, use \texttt{SCANSIZE}=9, \texttt{STEP-SIZE}=0.6, and \texttt{CENTER}=FWF.Where minimal TA time is required, use \texttt{SCAN-SIZE}=3, \texttt{STEP-SIZE}=1.3, and \texttt{CENTER}=FW.}\item{Signal-to-noise (S/N) is important to an accurate TA; use S/N=40 for PSA TAs, and S/N=60 for BOA.}\item{FUV spectroscopic TAs that require absolute photometric accuracy should avoid G160M \tacq{PEAKXD}s as these can occasionally be partially vignetted.The \tacq{PEAKXD} phase of FUV TA may not be able to properly center the target in the XD direction.This is partially due to errors in the Segment B-to-A mapping parameters, which should be updated.}\item{The WCA+MIRRORB \texttt{LTAIMCAL} TA subarrays should be reduced to avoid contamination from the rising NUV detector background. The \texttt{LTAIMAGE} subarrays could also be reduced; this would not affect the quality of the TA, but would reduce processing time of the centering step.\label{item:LTAIMCAL}}\item{The NUV imaging \tacq{SEARCH} TA subarrays should be reduced to avoid contamination from the rising NUV detector background.}\item{Due to incorrect WCA-to-PSA parameters, NUV BOA spectroscopic TAs will currently not correctly center the target in the aperture. No BOA spectroscopic TAs are scheduled for Cycle~17, and this will be corrected before Cycle~18.}\item{The current COS SAA contours should be adjusted to prevent any COS TAs from occuring in the elevated background region that currently exists over South America. COS TAs that use \tacq{SEARCH} and/or \tacq{PEAKD} will not center the target correctly in this region.\footnote{COS SAA contours were adjusted in PRs\# 65147, 65227, and 65188 on May 13--25, 2010}}\item{The number of counts in the primary spot from the wavelength calibrationlamp in \texttt{LTAIMCAL} in \texttt{MIRRORB} mode has been decreasing since SMOV. Reducing the size of the \texttt{LTAIMCAL} subarrays is planned (\ref{item:LTAIMCAL}, above) and will help with signal-to-noise issues, but may not be enough to negatively impact \tacq{IMAGE} + \texttt{MIRRORB} centering (one of the most used TA modes). The number of counts determined to have come from the wavelength calibration lamp during \texttt{LTAIMCAL} should be monitored, and the exposure time for \texttt{LTAIMCAL}+ \texttt{MIRRORB} may need to be increased for Cycle~19 and beyond.}\normalsize\end{enumerate}\clearpage\section{Change History for \thisISR}Version 0.5: April 2012 - Original DocumentVersion 0.6: May 2018\clearpage\input{references.tex}\clearpage\appendix\vspace{-0.3cm}\section{Appendix A: COS TA Subarrays}\label{sec:TAsubs}\vspace{-0.3cm}%\input{TA2_subarrays.tex}\clearpage\vspace{-0.4cm}\section{Appendix B: Description of TA FSW Parameters}\label{sec:FSWdescription}\vspace{-0.5cm}In this Appendix, the flight software (FSW) parameters are described.In Appendix~\ref{sec:FSWparameters}, the current and historic values of the parameters are given.

The offsets given in Table~\ref{table:TAcaltargetoffset} are in units of 0.1p, NUV, or XD digital elements (DE), FUV.\begin{deluxetable}{|l|r|r|r|l|}\tablewidth{0pt}\tabcolsep 12pt\tablecolumns{5}\tabletypesize{\footnotesize}\tablecaption{WCA-to-PSA/BOA Offsets.\label{table:TAcaltargetoffset}}\tablehead{\colhead{Mechanism}&\colhead{Detector}& \colhead{PSA} & \colhead{BOA} &\colhead{History}}\startdataOSM1\_G130M & FUV & -833 & -833& TVAC 2006 \\			&		& -822 &  & SMOV--SMS194 (PR\#63036)\\			&		& -878 & -860& SMOV--SMS201 (PR\#63095)\\OSM1\_G140L & FUV & -833 & -833& TVAC 2006 \\			&		& -850 & -832& SMOV--SMS194\\			&		& -864 & -846& SMOV--SMS201 (PR\#63095)\\OSM1\_G160M & FUV & -833 & -833& TVAC 2006 \\			&		& -816 & -798& SMOV--SMS194\\			&		& -878 & -860& SMOV--SMS201 (PR\#63095)\\OSM2\_G185M & NUV & 3712 & 3712& TVAC 2006 \\			&		& 3720 &  & SMOV--SMS194 (PR\#63036)\\			&		& 3742 & 3458& SMOV--SMS201 (PR\#63095)\\			&		&		 &	 \textbf{3692}	 & PR\#65152 \\OSM2\_G225M & NUV & 3712 & 3712& TVAC 2006 \\			&		& 3677 & 3597& SMOV--SMS194\\			&		& 3746 &  3462& SMOV--SMS201 (PR\#63095)\\			&		&		 &	\textbf{3689} & PR\#65152\\OSM2\_G230L & NUV & 3712 & 3712& TVAC 2006 \\			&		& 3647 &  & SMOV--SMS194 (PR\#63036)\\			&		& 3734 &  3450& SMOV--SMS201 (PR\#63095)\\			&		&		 &		\textbf{3685} & PR\#65152\\OSM2\_G285M & NUV & 3712 & 3712& TVAC 2006 \\			&		& 3691 & 3611& SMOV--SMS194\\			&		& 3749 & 3465& SMOV--SMS201 (PR\#63095)\\			&		&		 &	 \textbf{3667}& PR\#65152\\\enddata %UPdated April 14, 2010\tablecomments{Table values are XD offsets (\textsc{pcta\_CalTargetOffset)} in units of 0.1p (NUV) or 0.1DE (FUV).
