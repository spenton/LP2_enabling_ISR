COS is a slit-less spectrograph with a pair of circular apertures with radii of 1.25\arcsec. The Primary Science Aperture (PSA) is
placed at the location of the minimum beam waist, with the instrument focused on the sky. The Bright Object Aperture (BOA) is
identical to the PSA except that the aperture is filled with an $\sim$ND2 filter.
To achieve our FUV centering goals, we need to center a point source to within 0.3\arcsec\ in the cross-dispersion (XD) direction and 0.106\arcsec\ in the along-dispersion (AD) direction.

In this ISR we will discuss the performance of the COS FUV spectroscopic on-board target acquisition (TA) modes at the second lifetime position (LP2). Except for the obvious displacement of the TA sub-arrays is the Y direction, the only upadates required are to the grating specific plate scales and the WCA-to-PSA/BOA offsets.
